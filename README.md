# Concept  

## Features  
- **Switched boat velocity**
  - Boats are now fast on land and slow on water.
- **Piss...**  
  - Replaces water with... piss... (Thanks Dark...)  
  - Added Piss effect  
    - Switches `cos` and `sin` around for entities with the effect.  
    - You get this effect when in contact with water, or when you are effected by any potion.  
- OH NO! SOMEONE POISONED THE VINES!
  - Touching a vine now makes you light-headed.
- You're a really, really bad firebender...
  - Fire Charges can now be used like wind charges... but with fire. 🔥
  - There is a chance of you spawning a fireball when attacking an entity, every time this fails your chances for the next attack go up.
- Added Herobrine
  - uh well kind-of? Mannequins will now spawn around the player in the distance, if seen they will teleport somewhere else.
  - Mannequins will spawn with skins.

##  
- The streamed playthrough of this also played with the Element Animations April Fools Resource Pack, which can be found here: https://web.archive.org/web/20141118054421/https://www.elementanimation.com/TEAVSRP2.zip  
- As `Hostile Friends, and Passive Enemies` wasn't ready, the streamed playthrough used Fleecifer (Hostile Sheep) instead.

## Idea's that I didn't have time to implement:
- Hostile Friends, and Passive Enemies
    - Hostile and Passive mobs have been switched!
    - Neutral mobs are angry by default, and calm after attacking.
    - The ender dragon is being hurt by the crystals! Save it!
